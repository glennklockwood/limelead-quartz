GH200 is NVIDIA's "Grace Hopper Superchip" which combines a single [[Grace]] CPU with a [[H100]] or [[H100|H200]] GPU.^[1]

The GH200 platform also supports 18x NVLink 4 lanes out of each Hopper GPU, allowing for two GH200 superchips to be coherently connected (forming "GH200 NVL") or up to 256 GH200 superchips using NVLink Switch.[^1]
