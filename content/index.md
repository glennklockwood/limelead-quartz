title: Glenn's Digital Garden

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to keep track of technical topics at work, and this page is an experiment in publishing some of the material I've got in my persona knowledge base as an extension of [my personal website](https://www.glennklockwood.com/).

Until I figure out a better way to organize this information, here's everything I've got:

- [[tags/GPU]]
	- [[MI300X]]
	- [[H100]]
- [[tags/CPU]]
	- [[Grace]]
- [[tags/system]]
	- [[Isambard-AI]]
	- [[JUPITER]]

I am going to be copying content in here over time, and I'll probably be moving things around.
