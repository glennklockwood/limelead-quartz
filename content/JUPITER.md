JUPITER is the first European exascale supercomputer being installed for 2024 at Juelich. Technical details are here: [JUPITER Technical Overview (fz-juelich.de)](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc/jupiter/tech).

Two partitions:
- Booster Module:
	- "roughly 6,000 compute nodes"
	- GH200 - 2C:4G (so 24,000 [[H100|H200]])
	- "1 ExaFLOP/s (FP64, [[HPL]])"
- Cluster Module: SiPearl Rhea CPUs
	- "more than 1300 nodes"
	- "more than 5 PetaFLOP/s (FP64, HPL)"

Storage: IBM ESS 3500
